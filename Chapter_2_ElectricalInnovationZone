The only reason the Chinese Communist party wouldn't have an innovation zone in energy and power grid technologies is if the zone has already expanded across the entire country
Doubtful.

Sun Tzu allegorically is found in several CCP political and military strategies to gain influence and extend that influence without overt physical military prowress. 

The character for China  "中" (zhōng) eytmologicallly comes from being in the middle of the earth, (world? universe?)

I think the easiest way to plan out key pieces of an electrical innovation zone would be focusing on satellite imagery. 

do you know why ssolar panel fields can't easily be hidden from satellite intelligence? Because if they are hidden or covered, they are useless! 

Inferring from imagery where the most solar panels have been placed couldnt definitively say anything.
