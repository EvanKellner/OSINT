Develop a comparative policy analysis titled '[Province Name] Province's Government-Backed R&D Infrastructure: Strategic Parallels and Divergences from U.S. FFRDCs and UARCs'.

Structure the analysis to:

Contrast institutional models: Compare U.S. FFRDC/UARC systems (GOCO governance, mission-oriented funding) with Chinese provincial equivalents (e.g., 新型研发机构 in Guangdong/Zhejiang, 国家实验室分支机构).

Identify functional analogs: Map specific Chinese mechanisms (e.g., 军民融合协同创新中心 for defense-tech alignment, 重大科技基础设施共享平台 for national lab-style resource pooling) to U.S. counterparts.

Embed case studies: Analyze 2-3 provincial institutions (e.g., 安徽省量子信息科学实验室 for strategic science, 江苏省生物医药创新中心 for industry translation) through the FFRDC/UARC lens.

Propose hybrid mechanisms: Suggest reforms blending U.S. practices (multi-year federal contracts, contractor autonomy) with Chinese institutional realities (政府引导基金 funding, 揭榜挂帅 project models).

Requirements:

Use Chinese terminology for local institutions (实验室, 协同创新中心) alongside English equivalents

Highlight tensions between China's 新型举国体制 and U.S. public-private partnership paradigms

Conclude with actionable recommendations for 省级 policymakers on long-term R&D infrastructure governance"
