First off, I have heard the phrase Chinese innovation zones.
What in the Vault-Tec is an AI Innovation zone?

This chapter as this project evolves is just me trying to get a clear picture of the publicly available information on this Topic.

        Key Findings/(myComment)

        -   China’s AI ecosystem is a strategic priority of the CCP
            (Talk about ahead of the curve !)


        -   Two key ministries lead the government’s plans for AI development.
        -The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) ( China’s AI development strategies and academic research)
                    (Academic Research - that was a big focus of this OSINT project as I was conceptualizing it, I will see how if this plays out)
        -Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)  

        - Covid Leading to <30 day rollout of health apps    
        - AI Researchers pursueing grad school in USA, but talent for PhD's in Domestic education in China growing
        (Devil you Know versus devil you dont, AI research in America going to China, verus AI research in China perhaps 绝密 机密 秘密  )
        (When searchng the term for what chinese characters are used for classification purposes, I discovered author He Qinglian's "Media Control in China (中国政府如何控制媒体)". Writing this down to save for later. 
        - Ai In Chinas Power Grid / Management.    
        (Ok, thats new, and in 2021, attack vector... interesting, Sounds like that would be an innovation zone. )
